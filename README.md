# CollectorX

A side-project to maintain my JS knowledge base and familiarity with certain concepts (Webpack, Classes, Promises et al) that may be in danger of rusting away through disuse.

In this project:

-   MAIN CONCEPT: a single app where the user may record their collections of _everything_. I.e. anything that they own more than one of and wish to keep a record of somewhere. This app will be the central place to do that. (Possibly a full-scale app in due course, butjust a webapp for now).

-   Examples of things that could be recorded in this app: books, music, movies, clothes, computers, misc. technology, apps themselves, etc.

-   Will heavily lean upon the Class system. There will be a generic Class for an item and then a separate class for each type of item. (User-defined custom classes are **for the future**. Keeping the scope small for this project, for now. This is 99.99% an exercise in maintaining JS 'muscle tone'.)
